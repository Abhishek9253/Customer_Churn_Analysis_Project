## Objective:
Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services or stop using a product or service provided by a company, is a critical concern in the telecom industry. High churn rates can significantly impact a telecom companyâ€™s revenue, market share, and overall growth. This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of customer churn in the telecom industry using Power BI for data visualization and SQL for data extraction, transformation, and querying.

The project will utilize SQL to query and extract relevant customer data, focusing on key variables such as customer demographics, service types, contract types, usage patterns, and customer complaints. Once the data is retrieved, Power BI will be employed to create dynamic dashboards and visualizations that uncover valuable insights about customer churn patterns.

## Key Goals of the Project:
### Data Extraction and Preparation with SQL:
- Use SQL queries to extract customer data from telecom databases, focusing on attributes like age, gender, tenure, contract type, service types (e.g., fibre optic), region, and customer interactions. Data will also include historical churn records for analysis.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is structured and ready for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing data, creating views).

### Customer Churn Pattern Visualization in Power BI:
- Build interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize churn trends and patterns, allowing for easy exploration of factors influencing churn, such as customer demographics (age, gender), contract types, tenure, and service types.
- Generate actionable insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to churn, such as churn rate by customer segment, churn by service type, churn by contract type, and churn by region.
- Present recommendations to telecom companies on how to reduce churn, such as improving customer service, offering flexible contracts, or enhancing product offerings based on the data insights.
